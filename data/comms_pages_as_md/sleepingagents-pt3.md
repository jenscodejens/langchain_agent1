### Sleeping Agents: The Third Charm!

Most of you are familiar with the terms "Sleeping Agents" and "Reclaim PIX," but in short, this feature allows us to take back abandoned PIX from inactive players and give active players a chance to get a hold of otherwise "locked" PIX. This has been a game-changer for Planet IX and benefits all the active players in our ecosystem.

A lot of requests to bring back this feature have come in, and we've listened and obliged.


# What This Means:
Accounts that have not made a single PIX transaction since the launch of NetEmpire Evolution on March 10, 2025, are now considered inactive. These accounts have until August 31 to make a PIX transaction on NetEmpire. If an account is still inactive on August 31, we will move its PIX to tradable accounts owned by Planet IX.

This feature helps the game progress and grow the community. If your PIX has been claimed, you have 12 months to reclaim them. You'll get the same amount and tier of PIX that was claimed from you, to the best of our abilities.

We will take a snapshot for this on August 31, 23:59 UTC.


# Sleeping Agents in Short
Accounts inactive since March 10, 2025, will have their PIX claimed.

The claimed PIX will be sold back to the community for a fixed price.

The proceeds will go to Territory staking.

Players have 12 months from the time they wish to re-enter the game to reclaim their PIX, receiving the same amount and tier.
 

We are constantly evolving our economy and user experience to make the whole ecosystem more rewarding for everyone involved. Please note that we reserve the right to update our terms and conditions for the benefit of the community.
 

Thank you for your continued support, and let the gaming continue!
