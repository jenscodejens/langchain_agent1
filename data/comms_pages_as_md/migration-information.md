### Migration Updates


## The Next Season: Migrating to Base L2
Dear Planet IX Players,

The transition to Base, the Ethereum Layer-2 chain by Coinbase, marks the most significant and exciting development in our project's history. This migration is a massive undertaking designed to deliver superior security, efficiency, and a smoother gaming experience.

Below is the vital information regarding our launch on Base and the phased migration plan.


### I. Phase One: Migration Commencement (December 1st)
The first step of our comprehensive migration is scheduled for December 1st. We are moving our core assets and staking to Base.
## Assets Migrating to Base on Day One:
Polygon Asset	Base Asset	Details
IXT Token	AIX Token	1:1 conversion rate (subject to decay window below).
Mining Pass (NFT)	Mining Pass (NFT)	All existing NFTs will be migrated.
Meta Crystals (NFT)	Meta Crystals (NFT)	All existing Crystals will be migrated.
Staked IXT	Staked AIX	Staked IXT can be migrated to Staked AIX on Base.
## Important Note on Migration Permanence
All migrations of Tokens and NFTs are permanent and irreversible. We are fully committing to Base as our new home.


### II. New Base Staking & Rewards
Immediately following the migration, a new suite of staking opportunities will go live on Base.
## New Staking Pools Going Live on Base:
- Single Staking: 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month
- MetaCrystals Staking.
- Liquidity Pools: USDC-AIX and ETH-AIX.
## Staking Rewards 
## You will be able to claim your rewards at any time during the staking epoch


### Staking Update
After the locking period of staking pools has ended players will not earn more rewards, this includes Mining Pass. I.e after 6 months in 6 month staking pool players will not earn more rewards, they will need to re-stake their AIX to earn more.
## Polygon Staking Pause
All existing staking on Polygon, including MILK Staking, will be paused until the corresponding pools open on Base.
## Staked IXT: Rewards Conversion
Accrued rewards for staking IXT will be instantly claimable on Base as AIX. If you have accrued 1,000 IXT in rewards on Polygon, you will be able to claim 1,000 AIX immediately on Base.


### III. Game Loop Changes & Future Stages
The migration alters several existing game mechanics to align with the new ecosystem.
## Mining Pass Staking
Mining Passes on Base has a 3-month locking period. Mining Pass staking on Polygon will close. 
## Minting Changes
- Mining Passes: Minting will still be possible on Polygon using IXT. After the migration, it will also be possible to mint Passes directly on Base using AIX.
- Meta Crystals: Production of Meta Crystals on Polygon will no longer be possible.
## Drone Fleets
Drone Fleets will not be included in this first stage of migration. More information on their transition will be shared at a later date.


### IV. Gas Fees & Paymaster Service
To ensure a smooth transition, we are simplifying the initial user experience:
- Migration Gas Fees: Players must pay the gas fees on Polygon to initiate the migration of their assets.
- Base Launch: We will utilize the Base Paymaster service to ensure players do not have to worry about gas fees on Base for the migration process itself.
- Post-Migration Gas: After the initial migration, players will need to pay their own gas fees on Base, similar to how gas fees are paid for POL on Polygon.


### V. Token Conversion & Decay Window
To incentivize and reward the timely migration of IXT, a conversion decay window will be enforced for IXT tokens.
## 1:1 Conversion Window
Players will have 1 month from December 1st to migrate their IXT at the full 1:1 conversion rate to AIX.
## Decay Schedule
After the initial one-month window, the conversion rate will decay:
- After Month 1: 1 IXT = 0.95 AIX
- After Month 2 and Onwards: The decay will decrease further.
## Polygon Liquidity
The purchase of IXT on Polygon will remain possible as long as there is liquidity, but players are strongly encouraged to utilize the 1:1 migration window as soon as possible.
## NFT Decay
There will be no decay applied to the conversion of any NFTs.


### VI. AIX Purchase & Airdrop
## Purchasing AIX
AIX will be available for purchase on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) on Base, such as QuickSwap. The official contract address will be shared immediately upon launch.
## AIX Airdrop
Players who qualified for the AIX airdrop through opening Season 2 packs and playing Season 1 can expect an airdrop in December. The total amount will be vested and not paid out in one lump sum. The exact conversion rate of points to AIX will be shared soon. Similar to how IXT was vested when we launched IXT on Polygon back in 2021. We will release the vesting schedule in December.

## €1M Rush
Players who qualified for the 1M Rush, will be airdropped their rewards in December.
