### Maximise your rewards on BASE: AIX Staking and Liquidity Rewards

The foundation of the Planet IX economy is built on robust decentralized finance, and we’ve deployed massive rewards to solidify that future ensuring Season 2 will be a success. We have allocated a total of 24,000,000 AIX—that’s an incredible 1,000,000 AIX per month—over the next two years solely to reward players who choose to participate in AIX Staking and Liquidity Pool (LP) Staking. This is your chance to secure your share of the ecosystem’s expansion.



# Single AIX Staking: Unlock Your Yields
Getting started is designed to be frictionless. Our AIX single staking is now live on ix.foundation, offering 3 month, 6 month and 12 month staking. Simply connect your wallet, stake your tokens and enjoy your rewards. 
Your power to earn is directly tied to your commitment. Players dictate both the amount of AIX they wish to stake and the corresponding locking period. The longer you lock, the higher your potential rewards. 

We are constantly optimizing for player control and maximum yield potential. Our new staking pools introduce unprecedented flexibility, enabling players to claim their accrued rewards whenever they choose, even before the epoch has officially ended! To streamline participation, we have removed the one-month staking option, further encouraging deeper engagement for superior returns. Note that once a staking epoch completes, the AIX in that specific pool will no longer generate rewards.


# Liquidity Pool (LP) Staking: Power the Ecosystem
Liquidity Pools are a cornerstone of our decentralized exchange. They are the essential, crowdsourced engine locked within smart contracts, enabling seamless, instant trades and maintaining healthy price stability for AIX. Without a robust LP, players cannot freely buy or sell AIX on decentralized exchanges. Planet IX will through partners offer USDC-AIX and ETH-AIX staking possibilities. 

LP Staking is your opportunity to become a core contributor and earn AIX. By providing liquidity, you don't just secure the network—you actively demonstrate crucial ownership and ensure stable exchanges for all players. This vital engagement is rewarded with regular, substantial payouts to all liquidity providers that stake their LP tokens on ix.foundation.

A Critical Note on Risk: As with all decentralized finance products, LP Staking carries the inherent risk of Impermanent Loss and slippage. We strongly encourage every player to Do Your Own Research (DYOR) and understand the mechanics before committing capital.
