### Mining Pass on Base


Planet IX is migrating Mining Passes to Base - an innovative tool that allows users to maximize the utility of their AIX while benefiting from massive rewards. With Mining Pass players can participate in a highly rewarding staking system while contributing to the stability of AIX. 

__What is the Planet IX Mining Pass?__
The Mining Pass is an ERC-721 token (NFT) that users can get by locking up their AIX. It is also possible to mint a Mining Pass on Polygon and then migrate it to Base on ix.foundation. When staking the Mining Pass players can farm Meta Crystals, a valuable in-game resource. These crystals can be staked together with AIX to generate tokens as rewards.

__How do I get a Mining Pass?__
Lock the required amount of AIX to mint your Mining Pass. The Mining Pass comes in five different clearance levels, each offering varying levels of daily Meta Crystal output. These levels are based on the amount of AIX locked in by the user:

Clearance Level	AIX Requirement	Crystals Generated (per 24h)
1	370	1
2	2,600	11
3	18,000	120
4	126,000	1,330
5	1,000,000	14,600

The Mining Pass is engineered for strategic, high-yield asset control. To secure maximum returns and ensure the robust, long-term health of the AIX ecosystem, a 3 month locking period is required upon staking. 
When swapping in your Mining Pass to retrieve your original AIX amount, a seven day cooldown period is initiated. You must complete the cooldown period before you can claim your AIX. You start the cooldown period by going to the staking section and swapping in your Mining Pass.

__Mining Pass to Reduce AIX Supply, Driving Price Increase__
The Mining Pass will play a vital role in the overall tokenomics of Planet IX. From a game theory perspective, locking AIX tokens to obtain a Mining Pass reduces the available supply of tokens on the market. AIX combined with Crystal farming creates a dynamic system of compounding rewards, offering a highly attractive reward system for early adopters.
In theory, a reduction of tokens on the market creates upward pressure on the price of AIX, benefiting all token holders. That is what makes Mining Pass so advantageous for holders of AIX.
