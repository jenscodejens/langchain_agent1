### AIX Token Calculator

Planet IX introduces the AIX Token Calculator! With this tool you will be able to follow the journey towards your $AIX allocation! 

If you don’t understand how the calculator works you can follow this easy step-by-step guide that explains how to use it.

__Note:__ The multiplier and Season 2 points are currently not active. To achieve the multiplier you need to open Season 2 packs. Season 1 points are from actions taken in Season 1 of the game and grants ALL Season 1 players their fare share of $AIX. After the snapshot today, 28.08.25 you will not get any more Season 1 points. The only way to accumulate more $AIX after that is to open Season 2 packs.

# Here’s how it works:
1. First you sign in with the same wallet that you bought the Season 2 pack with

2.  When logged in you press Finish button and then a few parameters will be calculated:

__Game activity:__ How many points you’ve generated from playing Season 1
__IXT staking activity:__ How many points you’ve generated through staking in Season 1
__Registered pack value:__ The total value of the Season 2 packs that you’ve bought
__Current multiplier:__ This is based on the amount of Season 2 packs that you’ve opened
__Total points:__ This shows how many total points you got, S1 & S2 + multiplier included
__Total allocation:__ This shows how many tokens your points will get you
